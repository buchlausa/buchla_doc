Turn the center knob to the desired stage, chose the desired time range (one of three) and the voltage range (one of six).  Also select the voltage you\u2019d like to operate on (one or two).\nEach of the two voltages, as well as the time can be quantized \u2013 voltage in .1 volt increments, time in binary rhythmic increments of  .01, .02, .04, .08, .16, .32, .64, 1.28, 2.56, 5.12. Time values may be modified through application of an external control voltage scaled from 1/2 to 2.  Additional fixed scaling over a range of .25 through 4.0 may be achieved with a dedicated pot. A red quantize LED alerts you that you\u2019re very close to the edge of a quantize value. So keep it in the green.\nThe clock of the 250e can be synchronized to MIDI clock via a 225e. This can be selected on a stage by stage basis by setting the time range to the fourth (blank) value. All modes which require an internal clock to count down (ADV, SUST, ENA) will now wait for an appropriate number of MIDI clock ticks before proceeding. This clock division is set via the small time knob to one of seven values:\n\u2028\t1) thirty-second note\t\t5) eighth note\u2028\t2) sixteenth note triplet\t\t6) quarter note triplet\u2028\t3) sixteenth note\t\t\t7) quarter note\u2028\t4) eighth note triplet\u2028\u2028If stage 1 is set to use MIDI clock then MIDI start and stop will be obeyed as well. Upon receiving a MIDI start the sequencer will immediately reset to stage 1 for playback. When using MIDI clock the time mult knob and external voltage won\u2019t affect the clock division but will affect the interpolation time.\u2028\tEXTERNAL INPUTS:\nVoltages and times may be derived from external control voltage inputs on a stage by stage basis.  Controls for this trick reside in the lower left section.  While in the edit mode, select the desired stage number and switch on the time and/or voltage LED\u2019s with the associated switches.  Be sure to select the desired output voltage (1 or 2).  If these LEDs are on, then the stage pot, instead of setting a voltage or time, chooses between four inputs -- A, B, C or D -- for that stage. (Each stage follows the same selection scheme as drawn on stage 1).\nUse \u201cfix\u201d to grab an external voltage. The incoming voltage at the time \u201cfix\u201d is pressed becomes the fixed voltage, storing current values as if they were knob settings.  This can be a great short cut for storing a voltage in each stage without having to turn all the knobs.\nFix is a global control, and when on, (\u201cfix\u201d) disables external inputs.
