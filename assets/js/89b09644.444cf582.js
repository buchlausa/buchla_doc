Make sure the Program has the Pulser mode set at "sustain"--not "transient" \u2013if you want it to self-start. It will not predictably self-start in "transient" mode. A technical answer: The pulser uses the physical hardware and that hardware needs a capacitor to be primed/charged for it to self-start. In transient mode the application does not automatically do this. Partly this is a feature that allows you to start it yourself by pressing "one," but also because that middle setting on the switch of an older 208 is "off."
