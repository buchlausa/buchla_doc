Inserting the card reversed in the slot or while powered on may cause damage to the Program Manager Card.</strong></p><p>OVERVIEW</p><p>The Buchla Program Manager provides an easy means to store and recall up to 48 user presets for your 208C or 208<!-- -->*<!-- --> in the Easel Command or your Music Easel<!-- -->*<!-- -->. In addition, you get inversion and depth control of voltage control that are not accessible via the physical 208 panel <strong>.</strong> <em>*<!-- -->For 208&#x27;s please see the ADDENDUM and the end of this manual dedicated to issues related to older (pre-2018) <strong>Hardware</strong>.</em></p><p>The Buchla Program Manager App allows you to create &amp; edit virtually unlimited programs, share and store programs and banks to the Program Manager card via USB from a computer (OSX &amp; Windows). The Program Manager card and app includes a number of factory programs that can be customized and also serve as the basis for new programs.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="C:buchla_doc/static/img/pmmanual/pmman1-card.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><ol><li><strong>NAVIGATION BUTTONS</strong> - use to scroll through programs saved on the card (tip, to scroll quickly, after the initial button press, while holding, press and hold the other too)</li><li><strong>RECALL BUTTON</strong> - press to load the selected program</li><li><strong>DISPLAY</strong> - shows programs names &amp; number</li><li><strong>USB-C</strong> - connects to a Mac or PC for Program Management</li><li><strong>PROGRAM INTERFACE CONNECTOR</strong> - attaches to instrument</li></ol><p>PERFORMANCE USE</p><p>The Buchla Program Manager (BPM) card is simple to use. Ensuring your instrument power is off first, insert the BPM card&#x27;s PROGRAM INTERFACE CONNECTOR into the instrument PROGRAM INTERFACE slot with the DISPLAY facing towards the front of the instrument, so you can see it while performing. Power up your instrument and change the instrument CONTROL switch to &#x27;remote&#x27;. If your instrument has &#x27;both&#x27; mode, then you can use that too, but the controls will have an additive effect.</p><p>Use the NAVIGATION BUTTONS on the BPM card to scroll through the various presets, and press the RECALL BUTTON to load the selected preset shown on the DISPLAY.</p><p>PROGRAM MANAGEMENT</p><p>The Buchla Program Manager is available for both Mac (OSX 10.12+) &amp; PC (WIN7 &amp; WIN 10). Download the Buchla Program Manager application at <a href="https://buchla.com/ProgramManager" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://buchla.com/ProgramManager</a> and then install.</p><p>With your Program Manager Card properly inserted in the PROGRAM INTERFACE slot on your instrument, set to &#x27;remote&#x27; or &#x27;both&#x27; mode, and your computer connected to the Program Manager card via the USB-C connector (or use a USB to USB-C adapter cable), ensuring the instrument power is on - launch the Buchla Program Manager application. You may also connect the USB-C after the application is launched and the Program Card will automatically be detected.</p><p>There are two main views in the application: &quot;Program View&quot; and &quot;Bank View&quot;. Utility Bar buttons are specific to active view. For instance, in Program View, clicking &#x27;SAVE&#x27; will save the current program, whereas when in Bank View, clicking SAVE will save the current bank.</p><p>Upon launch, you will be presented with the &quot;Program View&quot;.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="C:buchla_doc/static/img/pmmanual/pmman2-software.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Create, edit, save and share programs using the Buchla Program Manager App.</p><ol><li><p>UTILITY BAR</p></li><li><p>NAME INPUT</p></li><li><p>NEW</p></li><li><p>SAVE</p></li><li><p>SAVE AS</p></li><li><p>SAVE TO CARD</p></li><li><p>NOTES</p></li><li><p>IMPORT</p></li><li><p>EXPORT</p></li><li><p>SIDE PANEL</p></li><li><p>PROGRAMS TAB</p></li><li><p>DEPTH TAB</p></li><li><p>BANKS TAB</p></li><li><p>SAVE BANK</p></li><li><p>SIDE PANEL TOGGLE</p></li><li><p>SORT LIST</p></li><li><p>LOAD PROGRAM</p></li><li><p>ADD/REMOVE PROGRAM TO BANK</p></li><li><p>DELETE PROGRAM</p></li><li><p>INSTRUMENT INTERFACE</p></li><li><p>PROGRAM NAME DISPLAY</p></li><li><p>CONNECTION STATUS</p></li><li><p>KNOB</p></li><li><p>SWITCHES</p></li><li><p>SLIDERS</p></li><li><p>BANANA JACKS</p></li></ol><p><strong>PROGRAM VIEW</strong></p><p>The application will show a green &#x27;Connected&#x27; message in the CONNECTION STATUS area if connected. A red &#x27;Not Connected&#x27; or a blank message means your instrument is not connected. If the connection is not made immediately, you may need to wait a few moments, or unplug and replug the cable.</p><p>When connected, changes made to the instrument interface in the application will control your actual instrument. Ensure that your instrument&#x27;s &quot;MASTER VOLUME&quot;, &quot;channelA&quot; and channelB&quot; knobs are turned up so you can hear the results.</p><p>Use the various buttons in the UTILITY BAR to create &amp; edit new programs, name them, save, save as new, add notes, import and export programs.</p><p>Saved programs are listed in the program view on the right side panel. Click the desired LOAD PROGRAM button to show it in the interface and hear it on the instrument. Loading programs in this way will not overwrite, nor save, to the Program Manger card itself. Programs can be deleted by clicking the DELETE PROGRAM button.</p><p>SWITCHES: Selected the switch itself will cycle through the options. You can also select the label next to the switch to directly set the switch to that option.</p><p>SLIDERS: Click and drag or with the slider handle selected, use the keyboard up and down arrow keys to make fine adjustments.</p><p>CV CONNECTIONS:Click a banana jack to activate it - it will glow red, and then click another banana jack to connect it to the first. Disconnect the same way. You can only connect inputs (black jacks) to outputs (colored jacks). Connections made have an additional control called, &quot;depth&quot;, which is accessed via the DEPTH tab in the SIDE PANEL. Depth allows you to scale the effect of the connection as well as invert it, on a connection by connection basis.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="C:buchla_doc/static/img/pmmanual/pmman3-cvconnections.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Connections are listed, color matched to their correlating banana cable, labeled with the output and input connections. Adjust the slider to the desired effect. Note: when inverting signals, you may need to adjust the correlating parameter&#x27;s offset slider to put in the expected range.</p><p>SEND TO CARD: Once you have saved or loaded a program into the Program View, the &quot;SAVE TO CARD&quot; button will display in the Utility Bar. Upon clicking, you will be asked to choose the destination slot on the Program Manager Card. Confirm by clicking &quot;SAVE TO PM CARD&quot;, which will proceed to save the program, overwriting any contents in that slot.</p><p>IMPORT AND EXPORT PROGRAMS: Share programs using the import and export buttons.</p><p>Upon clicking either, you will be presented with a file menu dialog for the source or destination file. Imported programs will automatically save into your programs list. The export button will only display if there is a saved program loaded into the Program View.</p><p>The SAVE PROGRAM button will turn red when there are unsaved changes to the Program.</p><p><strong>BANK VIEW</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="C:buchla_doc/static/img/pmmanual/pmman4-bankview.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Banks are groups of up to 48 Programs (24 if using the legacy iProgramCard) that can be sent to the Program Manger card at once or by slot.</p><p>Select &quot;BANKS&quot; in the side panel to display the Bank View.</p><p>The Utility Bar and Side Panel buttons and their functions are identical to those in the Program View, but are specific to banks.</p><p>Either load or create a new bank. You presented a grid of 48 slots representing destinations on the physical Program Manager card.</p><p>To place programs into the loaded bank, click on &quot;PROGRAMS&quot; in the side panel and now each entry in the list programs will show a plus or minus icon - plus to add, and minus to remove that program to the currently loaded bank. Programs will be added automatically to the next available slot in the bank.</p><p>Upon making changes, a &quot;SAVE BANK&quot; button will appear in the side panel menu, allowing you to save the active bank from the Program View for convenience. You can also do so by returning to the Bank View, and clicking SAVE there.</p><p>In the Bank View, move program locations by clicking the arrows in each slot. To remove a program from the bank, click the &#x27;X&#x27; icon(this does not permanently delete your program - but just from the bank). To individually save a program to its destination slot on the Program Manager Card, click the SEND icon in the upper left of the slot.</p><p>Once you have saved or loaded a bank into the Bank View, you will see the &quot;SEND TO CARD&quot; button, allowing you to save the entire bank of programs to the Program Manager Card. Upon clicking, you will see a screen confirming whether you wish to include any blank slots in the bank. If you click NO, blanks will be ignored and only filled slots will save to the card. If you click YES, this will overwrite the entire contents of the Program Manager Card.</p><p>Upon saving a bank to the card, you will see a progress screen, which will close when finished.</p><p>The SAVE BANK button will turn red when there are unsaved changes to the Bank.</p><p>IMPORT AND EXPORT BANKS: Share and backup entire banks of programs using the bank import and export buttons. All programs associated with the bank are included and imported or exported. The Export button only is when a bank has been loaded.</p><p><strong>ABOUT &amp; HELP</strong></p><p>The About &amp; Help screen, accessible through the dropdown in the top application menu bar, screen will show your current application version, check for updates and link to the documentation.</p><p><strong>SETTINGS</strong></p><p>The Settings screen, accessible through the dropdown in the top application menu bar, provides message and save time interval settings which should not be changed unless you are experiencing programs related to sending programs and banks to the Program Manager Card.</p><p><strong>TROUBLESHOOTING</strong></p><p><strong>USB connection issues?</strong></p><p>You may need to remove and reattach the USB cable to your computer for it to enumerate properly.</p><p><strong>I am getting crazy results from the Envelope Generator!</strong>
Make sure the physical switch on the front panel is NOT in &quot;self&quot; mode. &quot;Self&quot; mode on the EG is a closed local circuit loop trigger selection. Though the timing will be altered by the remote settings, it will only self trigger. To anthropomorphize it: Local &quot;self&quot; mode on EG is selfish, stubborn and unrepentant. No matter how much you push it, it will not give up control.</p><p><strong>Sometimes my pulser starts and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. Why?</strong>
Make sure the Program has the Pulser mode set at &quot;sustain&quot;--not &quot;transient&quot; –if you want it to self-start. It will not predictably self-start in &quot;transient&quot; mode. <em>A technical answer: The pulser uses the physical hardware and that hardware needs a capacitor to be primed/charged for it to self-start. In transient mode the application does not automatically do this. Partly this is a feature that allows you to start it yourself by pressing &quot;one,&quot; but also because that middle setting on the switch of an older 208 is &quot;off.&quot; Now if the pulser has already been active, the capacitor is therefore primed and will self-start even in that &quot;transient&quot; position.</em></p><p>OLDER 208 RELATED TROUBLESHOOTING:</p><p><strong>I don&#x27;t have a &quot;both&quot; mode on my old 208, but it&#x27;s acting crazy in the middle switch setting!</strong>
Yes indeed! Both mode electronically exists on all 208&#x27;s regardless of whether the Program Manager Card knows it. That means that the control voltages will sum, but also the switches will sum and therefore be extra unpredictable. It can lead to some very fun results. It could be frightening to delicate ears, but it is not dangerous. Please make sure you made the necessary modifications to the card to ensure the card will always list two modes, &quot;Local mode&quot; and &quot;Remote mode&quot; or make the Both mode modification to your Easel to get all four modes.</p><p><strong>The pulser runs at a different rate from my 208 or my friend&#x27;s 208C!</strong>
The setting of the period of the Pulser is not an exact science. Don Buchla&#x27;s circuit will never exactly match the timings displayed on the front panel, but the most musical compromise was chosen for your 208C. Older 208&#x27;s did not have a factory prescribed setting. The trims from BEMI or older 208Cs may be set less consistently and typically are slower. If you really want to dive in deeper and get technical, you can alter that timing.</p><p><em>Getting technical: Pulser &quot;period&quot;/speed is set by a user accessible trim on the underside of the 208C called P-CAL.

WARNING</p><p>Always insert and remove the card with the display facing the user and with the power off. Inserting the card reversed in the slot or while powered on may cause damage to the Program Manager Card.</p><p>OVERVIEW</p><p>The Buchla Program Manager provides an easy means to store and recall up to 48 user presets for your 208C or 208<em> in the Easel Command or your Music Easel</em>. In addition, you get inversion and depth control of voltage control that are not accessible via the physical 208 panel . *For 208&#x27;s please see the ADDENDUM and the end of this manual dedicated to issues related to older (pre-2018) Hardware.</p><p>The Buchla Program Manager App allows you to create &amp; edit virtually unlimited programs, share and store programs and banks to the Program Manager card via USB from a computer (OSX &amp; Windows). The Program Manager card and app includes a number of factory programs that can be customized and also serve as the basis for new programs.</p><p>NAVIGATION BUTTONS - use to scroll through programs saved on the card (tip, to scroll quickly, after the initial button press, while holding, press and hold the other too)
RECALL BUTTON - press to load the selected program
DISPLAY - shows programs names &amp; number
USB-C - connects to a Mac or PC for Program Management
PROGRAM INTERFACE CONNECTOR - attaches to instrument
PERFORMANCE USE</p><p>The Buchla Program Manager (BPM) card is simple to use. Ensuring your instrument power is off first, insert the BPM card&#x27;s PROGRAM INTERFACE CONNECTOR into the instrument PROGRAM INTERFACE slot with the DISPLAY facing towards the front of the instrument, so you can see it while performing. Power up your instrument and change the instrument CONTROL switch to &#x27;remote&#x27;. If your instrument has &#x27;both&#x27; mode, then you can use that too, but the controls will have an additive effect.</p><p>Use the NAVIGATION BUTTONS on the BPM card to scroll through the various presets, and press the RECALL BUTTON to load the selected preset shown on the DISPLAY.</p><p>PROGRAM MANAGEMENT</p><p>The Buchla Program Manager is available for both Mac (OSX 10.12+) &amp; PC (WIN7 &amp; WIN 10). Download the Buchla Program Manager application at <a href="https://buchla.com/ProgramManager" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://buchla.com/ProgramManager</a> and then install.</p><p>With your Program Manager Card properly inserted in the PROGRAM INTERFACE slot on your instrument, set to &#x27;remote&#x27; or &#x27;both&#x27; mode, and your computer connected to the Program Manager card via the USB-C connector (or use a USB to USB-C adapter cable), ensuring the instrument power is on - launch the Buchla Program Manager application. You may also connect the USB-C after the application is launched and the Program Card will automatically be detected.</p><p>There are two main views in the application: &quot;Program View&quot; and &quot;Bank View&quot;. Utility Bar buttons are specific to active view. For instance, in Program View, clicking &#x27;SAVE&#x27; will save the current program, whereas when in Bank View, clicking SAVE will save the current bank.</p><p>Upon launch, you will be presented with the &quot;Program View&quot;.</p><p>Create, edit, save and share programs using the Buchla Program Manager App.</p><p>UTILITY BAR</p><p>NAME INPUT</p><p>NEW</p><p>SAVE</p><p>SAVE AS</p><p>SAVE TO CARD</p><p>NOTES</p><p>IMPORT</p><p>EXPORT</p><p>SIDE PANEL</p><p>PROGRAMS TAB</p><p>DEPTH TAB</p><p>BANKS TAB</p><p>SAVE BANK</p><p>SIDE PANEL TOGGLE</p><p>SORT LIST</p><p>LOAD PROGRAM</p><p>ADD/REMOVE PROGRAM TO BANK</p><p>DELETE PROGRAM</p><p>INSTRUMENT INTERFACE</p><p>PROGRAM NAME DISPLAY</p><p>CONNECTION STATUS</p><p>KNOB</p><p>SWITCHES</p><p>SLIDERS</p><p>BANANA JACKS</p><p>PROGRAM VIEW</p><p>The application will show a green &#x27;Connected&#x27; message in the CONNECTION STATUS area if connected. A red &#x27;Not Connected&#x27; or a blank message means your instrument is not connected. If the connection is not made immediately, you may need to wait a few moments, or unplug and replug the cable.</p><p>When connected, changes made to the instrument interface in the application will control your actual instrument. Ensure that your instrument&#x27;s &quot;MASTER VOLUME&quot;, &quot;channelA&quot; and channelB&quot; knobs are turned up so you can hear the results.</p><p>Use the various buttons in the UTILITY BAR to create &amp; edit new programs, name them, save, save as new, add notes, import and export programs.</p><p>Saved programs are listed in the program view on the right side panel. Click the desired LOAD PROGRAM button to show it in the interface and hear it on the instrument. Loading programs in this way will not overwrite, nor save, to the Program Manger card itself. Programs can be deleted by clicking the DELETE PROGRAM button.</p><p>SWITCHES: Selected the switch itself will cycle through the options. You can also select the label next to the switch to directly set the switch to that option.</p><p>SLIDERS: Click and drag or with the slider handle selected, use the keyboard up and down arrow keys to make fine adjustments.</p><p>CV CONNECTIONS:Click a banana jack to activate it - it will glow red, and then click another banana jack to connect it to the first. Disconnect the same way. You can only connect inputs (black jacks) to outputs (colored jacks). Connections made have an additional control called, &quot;depth&quot;, which is accessed via the DEPTH tab in the SIDE PANEL. Depth allows you to scale the effect of the connection as well as invert it, on a connection by connection basis.</p><p>Connections are listed, color matched to their correlating banana cable, labeled with the output and input connections. Adjust the slider to the desired effect. Note: when inverting signals, you may need to adjust the correlating parameter&#x27;s offset slider to put in the expected range.</p><p>SEND TO CARD: Once you have saved or loaded a program into the Program View, the &quot;SAVE TO CARD&quot; button will display in the Utility Bar. Upon clicking, you will be asked to choose the destination slot on the Program Manager Card. Confirm by clicking &quot;SAVE TO PM CARD&quot;, which will proceed to save the program, overwriting any contents in that slot.</p><p>IMPORT AND EXPORT PROGRAMS: Share programs using the import and export buttons.</p><p>Upon clicking either, you will be presented with a file menu dialog for the source or destination file. Imported programs will automatically save into your programs list. The export button will only display if there is a saved program loaded into the Program View.</p><p>The SAVE PROGRAM button will turn red when there are unsaved changes to the Program.</p><p>BANK VIEW</p><p>Banks are groups of up to 48 Programs (24 if using the legacy iProgramCard) that can be sent to the Program Manger card at once or by slot.</p><p>Select &quot;BANKS&quot; in the side panel to display the Bank View.</p><p>The Utility Bar and Side Panel buttons and their functions are identical to those in the Program View, but are specific to banks.</p><p>Either load or create a new bank. You presented a grid of 48 slots representing destinations on the physical Program Manager card.</p><p>To place programs into the loaded bank, click on &quot;PROGRAMS&quot; in the side panel and now each entry in the list programs will show a plus or minus icon - plus to add, and minus to remove that program to the currently loaded bank. Programs will be added automatically to the next available slot in the bank.</p><p>Upon making changes, a &quot;SAVE BANK&quot; button will appear in the side panel menu, allowing you to save the active bank from the Program View for convenience. You can also do so by returning to the Bank View, and clicking SAVE there.</p><p>In the Bank View, move program locations by clicking the arrows in each slot. To remove a program from the bank, click the &#x27;X&#x27; icon(this does not permanently delete your program - but just from the bank). To individually save a program to its destination slot on the Program Manager Card, click the SEND icon in the upper left of the slot.</p><p>Once you have saved or loaded a bank into the Bank View, you will see the &quot;SEND TO CARD&quot; button, allowing you to save the entire bank of programs to the Program Manager Card. Upon clicking, you will see a screen confirming whether you wish to include any blank slots in the bank. If you click NO, blanks will be ignored and only filled slots will save to the card. If you click YES, this will overwrite the entire contents of the Program Manager Card.</p><p>Upon saving a bank to the card, you will see a progress screen, which will close when finished.</p><p>The SAVE BANK button will turn red when there are unsaved changes to the Bank.</p><p>IMPORT AND EXPORT BANKS: Share and backup entire banks of programs using the bank import and export buttons. All programs associated with the bank are included and imported or exported. The Export button only is when a bank has been loaded.</p><p>ABOUT &amp; HELP</p><p>The About &amp; Help screen, accessible through the dropdown in the top application menu bar, screen will show your current application version, check for updates and link to the documentation.</p><p>SETTINGS</p><p>The Settings screen, accessible through the dropdown in the top application menu bar, provides message and save time interval settings which should not be changed unless you are experiencing programs related to sending programs and banks to the Program Manager Card.</p><p>TROUBLESHOOTING</p><p>USB connection issues?</p><p>You may need to remove and reattach the USB cable to your computer for it to enumerate properly.</p><p>I am getting crazy results from the Envelope Generator! Make sure the physical switch on the front panel is NOT in &quot;self&quot; mode. &quot;Self&quot; mode on the EG is a closed local circuit loop trigger selection. Though the timing will be altered by the remote settings, it will only self trigger. To anthropomorphize it: Local &quot;self&quot; mode on EG is selfish, stubborn and unrepentant. No matter how much you push it, it will not give up control.</p><p>Sometimes my pulser starts and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. Why? Make sure the Program has the Pulser mode set at &quot;sustain&quot;--not &quot;transient&quot; –if you want it to self-start. It will not predictably self-start in &quot;transient&quot; mode. A technical answer: The pulser uses the physical hardware and that hardware needs a capacitor to be primed/charged for it to self-start. In transient mode the application does not automatically do this. Partly this is a feature that allows you to start it yourself by pressing &quot;one,&quot; but also because that middle setting on the switch of an older 208 is &quot;off.&quot; Now if the pulser has already been active, the capacitor is therefore primed and will self-start even in that &quot;transient&quot; position.</p><p>OLDER 208 RELATED TROUBLESHOOTING:</p><p>I don&#x27;t have a &quot;both&quot; mode on my old 208, but it&#x27;s acting crazy in the middle switch setting! Yes indeed! Both mode electronically exists on all 208&#x27;s regardless of whether the Program Manager Card knows it. That means that the control voltages will sum, but also the switches will sum and therefore be extra unpredictable. It can lead to some very fun results. It could be frightening to delicate ears, but it is not dangerous. Please make sure you made the necessary modifications to the card to ensure the card will always list two modes, &quot;Local mode&quot; and &quot;Remote mode&quot; or make the Both mode modification to your Easel to get all four modes.</p><p>The pulser runs at a different rate from my 208 or my friend&#x27;s 208C! The setting of the period of the Pulser is not an exact science. Don Buchla&#x27;s circuit will never exactly match the timings displayed on the front panel, but the most musical compromise was chosen for your 208C. Older 208&#x27;s did not have a factory prescribed setting. The trims from BEMI or older 208Cs may be set less consistently and typically are slower. If you really want to dive in deeper and get technical, you can alter that timing.</p><p>Getting technical: Pulser &quot;period&quot;/speed is set by a user accessible trim on the underside of the 208C called P-CAL. If you feel you need to adjust your unit(s) this can be done with minimal effort. On the 208C, this trim is placed so that it is still accessible even with the reverb and an embedded Program Manager installed. Older 208&#x27;s also have this PERIOD CALIBRATION trim on board4.</p><p>FAQs: Does the PM Card work with the Card Doubler?</p><p>Yes.
