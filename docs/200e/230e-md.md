# The Buchla 230e
### Triple Envelope Tracker

 The 230e contains two sections. The bottom portion is comprised of three preamplifiers with the option of phantom power. The top section is comprised of three envelope followers with decay time and pulse output.

## Triple Preamplifier
 Each of the three channels of preamplification are made up of an XLR/quarter inch input, a grey-topped (not saved in preset creation) gain knob with button-activated "gain sets" at increasing decibel ranges, the option of phantom power, and an output.

**Phantom Power:** To activate phantom power on a preamplifier channel, you can hold the "gain set" button for over a second. The phantom power indicator LED will light.

**Mixed output:** In addition to each channel of the preamplifier having its own output, there is also an output that provides a mix of all three channels.

**Expand input:** If you'd like to add an external signal to the output of this module, you can plug it into the "expand INPUT" jack.

## Triple Envelope Tracker
 The Triple Envelope Tracker is made up of three envelope followers than convert the amplitude variation of input signals to variation in voltages for controlling other modules.

### Normalled inputs
The outputs of the three preamplifier channels are hard-wired to the inputs of the envelope followers. No connection is necessary if you intend for the signals from the preamplifiers to be input in their corresponding envelope follower. However, if you want to use an external sound source, you only need plug it into the input for an envelope follower channel to disconnect this "normalled" connection and use your external signal.

**Signal Input Sensitivity:** Each channel has a blue-capped knob (the settings of these knobs will be saved in a preset) with which you can adjust the input of your signal to the envelope follower. Each channel has an LED meter to help you appropriately adjust your input. If the output voltage exceeds 10 volts, the red "overload" LED will light.

**Control Voltage Output section:** Each channel has a blue voltage control output jack, where the resultant variations in voltage created by the variations in amplitude present in your input signal will be output. Also included is a blue-capped (the settings of these knobs will be saved in a preset) "decay time" knob that sets the decay of your CV output. It can be set from .1 to 10 seconds.

**Pulse Output section:** A voltage pulse that is short and exceeds five volts will generate a short "transient" output pulse. If a pulse level exceeds and holds five volts, it will create a "sustained pulse." When a sustained pulse is happening, the "action" LED will glow dimly.

 If the pulse button is pressed, it will activate the "trans" setting. In the "trans" setting, transient pulses are only created when an input voltage of significant increase occurs independent of the level. These will cause the "action" LED to flash brightly. In this way, transient signals can generate pulses in the presence of background sounds that keep sustained voltage levels. This is useful, for example, when extracting beat pulses from drums.

### Remote Enable
 To connect or disconnect this module from the central library function, press the "Remote Enable" button. Connection is indicated by a lit LED.
