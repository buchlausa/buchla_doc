# Model 207e Mixer / Preamplifier

A dual function module, the top section is a 6 in by 2 out mixer identical to the 206e mixer; the bottom section is a microphone preamplifier, to be described subsequently.

The mixer portion features pan controls for each channel. Channels 1 and 6 are voltage controlled, while channels 2 â€“ 5 are set with dedicated knobs. Note that channel 1 is, by default, directed to the left output; an increasing voltage will move its signal toward the right. Channel 6 behaves similarly, but with reversed response. Gain adjustments are provided for each input channel. Output levels for the left and right output channels are monitored with LED VU meters, with + 10 db levels occurring just prior to clipping.

A headset monitor is also provided. Its level setting is not stored as part of a preset.

The bottom section of the 207e is a preamplifier. Gain is switch selectable, with a sustained press (1 second) toggling the phantom power for all the channels.

An envelope follower with c.v. output is also provided; LED's indicate low, normal and clipping levels.

To connect or disconnect this module from the central library function, push the remote switch. The lighted LED signifies a connection..

The 207e's settings may be locally stored and subsequently recalled by the Preset Manager, a portion of both the 206e and 225e modules.
