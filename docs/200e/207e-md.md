## The 207e Mixer / Preamplifier

This module is comprised of two sections:

1. A six-channel two output mixer
2. A preamplifier with an envelope detector

## Mixer

The mixer features six audio channels, each with gain knob settings that can be stored in a preset.

Channels 2 through 5 have panning control knobs whose settings can be stored in a preset. Channels 1 and 6 have a default setting of being panned full left and full right respectively, but each has a dedicated banana jack allowing independent voltage control of the panning of each channel.

Output levels for the left and right output channels are indicated with LED VU meters that indicate imminent clipping at +10dB.

The stereo headphone jack features its own level setting knob that is not stored in the preset, despite its color.

The Remote Enable button controls the connection status of the module with the Preset Manager. When the LED is lit, the module is connected. The 206e settings can be locally stored and subsequently recalled by the Preset Manager.

## The Preamplifier

The bottom portion of the 207e is a preamplifier.

 The amplifier gain is knob-adjustable, and features a button that amplifies in levels of 10dB, 25dB, and 40dB to adjust to different types of input.

 Pressing the gain select button for more than one second will activate phantom power for the XLR input. Holding the button again will turn it off. When phantom power is on, the phantom power LED will light.

 The preamplifier also includes an Envelope Detector, which converts input amplitude to output control voltage through a banana jack for modulation use in a 200e system. A small LED meter indicates input level.

 The preamplifier output signal is available via two tinijack outputs. The outputs are duplicates of the same output signal.
