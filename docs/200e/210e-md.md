# Buchla 210e
## Control Voltage and Signal Router

 The Buchla 200e series is a unique modular design that allows the storage of presets through the fact that each module has its own processor and memory. Each module is a computer that is aware of the positions of its buttons and knobs. But this fact is really only half of what is necessary to actually and completely store a patch in a modular system. Because each of these modules is connected by cables, you'll need to ALSO store cable connections. But how is THAT to be done?

 The Buchla 210e was originally intended to be the second part of modular patch storageâ€¦ a means of storing cable connections. If the user defines a permanent cable architecture to connect their modules in ways that they can reuse for all of their patches, the 210e can be used to store different connections and amounts without plugging or unplugging a single cable. And, all of the module routing and amounts that are set within the 210e are stored as a patch. This allows you to save wildly different connections all from one single module.

## How does it work?

 There are two sections present in the 210e: the audio signal router and the control voltage router.

## The Audio Signal Router

 There are eight audio tinijack inputs along the left side of the router that are labeled with letters. These are the audio inputs.

 There are five audio tinijack outputs along the top of the router that are the audio outputs.

 If you plug an audio source into an input using the "output" and "input" buttons to select the LED that corresponds to the linear intersection of the output and input, you can make a connection from an input to any or all outputs. Likewise, multiple inputs can be directed to a single output.

 Plug an audio source into A.
 Plug a cable intended for output output into 4.
 Select input A with the "input" button by pressing it until the LED associated with input A is selected.
 Select output 4 with the "output" button by pressing it until the LED associated with output 4 is selected.
 Use the "AMPLITUDE" knob to adjust the amplitude of that connection.
 Now, the audio fed into A is directed to output 4 at the amplitude you have selected.

 The LEDs associated with the "AMPLITUDE" knob communicate information about the level you select with it.
 1. If only the orange LED is lit, the output level is lower than full-scale.
 2. If the orange and red LEDs are lit, the output is at unity gain or more.
 3. If only the red LED is lit, the output is at maximum.

 Multiple inputs sent to a single output are mixed/summed.

 The AMPLITUDE knob is also a button. If you push it instead of turning it, it will make a full connection between the selected intersection of input and output. If that connection exists already, it will disconnect it.

### The Solo button

 The Solo button auditions the effect of a single input. All other inputs will be disabled.

 The Solo button also turns the display into an indicator of the coefficients associated with the five selected outputs for both the audio and control voltage inputs. The thresholds for the LEDs are roughly .2, 1.6, 3.0, 4.4, 5.8, 7.2, 8.6, and 10.0.

 Press the Solo button again to escape this display.

## The Control Voltage Router

 The Control Voltage Router operates in a similar fashion to the Audio Signal Router; there are eight control voltage inputs along the left, and five control voltage outputs along the top. Making connections between inputs and outputs is achieved in the same way, with the "LEVEL" knob adjusting the amount of the output. If more than one input is directed to a single output, the input voltages are summed.

 The LEDs associated with the LEVEL knob indicate the intensity of the output of the voltage associated with an input.

### Preset Storage

 All of the connections and their amounts will be stored with the preset you're working on is stored. This means that if you are able to create a structure of patch cables that envisions all of the potential routings you would typically use, you are perfectly able to recreate any patch you design in a preset.

 To connect or disconnect this module from the central library function, push the "Remote Enable" button. The lit LED indicates that the module is currently connected.
