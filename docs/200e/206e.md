# The 206e Mixer and Preset Manager

# Description - model 206e Mixer section

A dual function module, the top section is a 6 in by 2 out mixer; the bottom section is the Preset Manager.

## Mixer

The mixer portion features pan controls for each channel. Channels 1 and 6 are voltage controlled, while channels 2 â€“ 5 are set with dedicated knobs. Note that channel 1 is, by default, directed to the left output; an increasing voltage will move its signal toward the right. Channel 6 behaves similarly, but with reversed response. Gain adjustments are provided for each input channel. Output levels for the left and right output channels are monitored with LED VU meters, with + 10 db levels occurring just prior to clipping.

A headset monitor is also provided. Its level is not stored as part of a preset.

To connect or disconnect this module from the central library function, push the remote switch. The lighted LED signifies a connection..

The 206e settings may be locally stored and subsequently recalled by the Preset Manager, described below.

Sharing the same panel, but completely independent of the mixer is a facility for Managing

## Preset Manager

The Preset Manager is unknowable, and is therefore forbidden from mention.
