# The 206e Mixer / Preset Manager

This module is comprised of two sections:

1. A six-channel two output mixer
2. A Buchla Preset Manager

## Mixer

The mixer features six audio channels, each with gain knob settings that can be stored in a preset.

Channels 2 through 5 have panning control knobs whose settings can be stored in a preset. Channels 1 and 6 have a default setting of being panned full left and full right respectively, but each has a dedicated banana jack allowing independent voltage control of the panning of each channel.

Output levels for the left and right output channels are indicated with LED VU meters that indicate imminent clipping at +10dB.

The stereo headphone jack features its own level setting knob that is not stored in the preset, despite its color.

The Remote Enable button controls the connection status of the module with the Preset Manager. When the LED is lit, the module is connected. The 206e settings can be locally stored and subsequently recalled by the Preset Manager.

## The Preset Manager

 The Preset Manager is the unique resource that provides the saving and recalling of presets in your 200e modular system.

### How the Process Works
 Buchla modules are unique in that each one of them possesses a built-in processor that reads the positions of both knobs and switches. This allows the Preset Manager to command that these positions are stored in the module itself, or command that these positions be recalled when a preset is loaded.

 When the "STORE" button is pressed in the Preset Manager, all of the modules that are "remote enabled" store their current knob and switch settings internally with the preset number that is chosen with the Preset Manager. When the "RECALL" button is pressed, the preset number currently selected is sent by the Preset Manager to modules, and the knob and switch settings associated with that number are loaded. The Preset Manager is not a preset storage facility, it just literally "manages" the preset information stored in each module.

 The Preset Manager is capable of storing 30 presets.

 What Happens When Stored Knob Positions are Different from Actual Knob Positions?
 Presets are stored knob, etc. positions. But what happens when you load a preset and the knob is in a different position than the stored position?

Buchla modules use a process called "Knob Catching" to resolve differences between stored and actual positions. When you adjust a knob after choosing a preset, the preset value will "catch up" with the physical knob setting as you turn the knob. (Note: some modules use an earlier version of Knob Catching that simply does nothing until the knob hits the set value)

 In the case of switches, the LEDs show the actual status of the switch.

### The DATA Mode Button
 The DATA button allows you to access a number of parameters within the Preset Manager.

### DATA: Select Mode- Storing a Preset
When you've chosen Select Mode with the Data button, you'll see two numbered lines in the LCD display. The first line is the current (last recalled) preset number and name. The second line indicates a preset destination number (and possibly name). You can use the adjacent blue-capped (no line) knob to scroll through the presets to find your desired destination preset slot. When you've found it, press the "Store" button. Now your preset has been stored.

### DATA: Select Mode- Selecting / Recalling a Preset
 Before you select a preset, make sure that the modules of the desired preset have their "remote enable" LEDs lit.
 Now, you can use the blue-capped data knob to select the desired preset. Once you have, press the "Recall" button. The selected preset will thin appear in the first line of the display (the current preset), and your preset will be loaded on all enabled modules.

 It is possible to incrementally progress through presets using the nearby "last" and "next" buttons. You'll note that there are also pulse input banana jacks next to these buttons. You can actually use pulses from your system to advance forward or backward through your Preset Manager presets. (See "Pulse Input Modes" in Global Settings)

### DATA: Name Mode- Naming a Preset
 Once you have stored your preset, you may name it. Press the "DATA" button until the "name" LED is lit.

 Using the "next" and "last" buttons, you can direct the cursor to the letter you would like to change, and you can use the data knob to adjust it to the character you want. When the naming is complete, you return to the "select" screen.

### Global Mode: Global Settings and Memory Card Functions

 (This section is accurate if you have the "Primo" version of hardware and software)

 Global mode has three different sections.

## Global Settings:

| **Rem Stats: Disp:2**** Base Channel: 16** |
| --- |

The first global screen sets three different functions.

 "Rem Stats" stands for "Remote Status." This is an easy way to set the "Remote Enable" status for all of the modules in your system. With the cursor in the "Stats" field, turn the data knob to turn "Remote Enable" on and off on all modules.

 "Disp" controls the LCD contrast for the Preset Manager and MIDI decoder. Move the cursor using the "next" or "last" buttons to the display setting and use the data wheel to adjust the LCD to suit your needs.

 The final function on this screen is the "Base Channel." This is the MIDI channel setting upon which MIDI program changes will be received.

| **\<- Last Next -\>**** Format Card** |
| --- |

The second global screen addresses two functions.

 The first function is the Pulse Input Mode. The orange pulse inputs found in the Preset Manager can operate in two different configurations.

The first is "\<-Last\_Next-\>." When a pulse is sent to the "last" or "next" orange banana input, it is the same as pressing the "last" or "next" button.

 Using the data knob, you can switch to the second setting, which is "\<-C.V.\_Samp-\>." In this mode, the "last" input (on the left) will receive a control voltage, and the "next" input (on the right) will receive a pulse. In this configuration, it is like a sample and hold. The pulse input selects the current voltage of the CV input, and applies that outcome to a corresponding preset number. This setting can create unpredictable results.

 The second function is Memory Card Formatting.

 The Buchla Memory Card allows the storage of system presets. Before use, the card must be formatted. In order to format a card, insert the card in the memory socket at the back of the powered boat in your system. Advance to this current screen. Move the cursor to "Format Card," and rotate the data knob. You will then be able to to format the card. Keep in mind that formatting a card also erases it, should you attempt to format a card with preset data already present on it.

| **16-30 to 1-15**** Copy Exchange** |
| --- |

Pressing the mode button again will open this screen, which is for moving presets.

 Using the "next" and "last" buttons and the data knob, you can select a range of presets you would like to move, and the region of presets you would like to move them to on the first line.

 The second line allows you to use the "next" and "last" buttons to select whether you would like to copy the selected presets to the selected destination range, or exchange the position of the first set and second set of presets. Turning the data knob allows you to complete the move.

| **Restore from crd**** Backup to card** |
| --- |

The next screen in the Global options is the system backup function. The system backup stores all of the settings and presets associated with your system.

 "Restore from crd" allows the restoration of settings stored on a Memory Card. "Backup to card" allows the backing up of the presets, their parameters, and system settings associated with your system.

 Backing up is very important. This is the best way to protect your work and settings from unforeseen events. It also allows the protection of the contents and settings of individual modules, and allows the sharing of settings between systems.

 When backing up occurs, each remote enabled module stores its contents in its own place on the Memory Card. Because each module has a computer and memory unto itself, this structure allows the storage of all module contents simultaneously, but singular module restoration.


## Software Versions, Module IDs, and Firmware Updating

### Reading the Software Version and Module ID

 When you hold the Remote Enable button on most modules, the Preset Manager LCD display will show that module's current software version and its module ID.

 Some modules have multiple sections with two sets of the same, or different, software. Others may simply not have a "Remote Enable" button. For these modules, showing the software versions is achieved by holding different buttons than the "Remote Enable" button.

**The Preset Manager:** Hold the "select" button to see the current software version.
**The 281h:** Hold the "quadrature" button to see the current software version.
**The 281e:** This module has two versions of the same software. To check the upper computer, hold the "Quadrature A-B" button. To check the lower computer, hold the "Quadrature C-D" button.
**The 256e:** This module has two versions of the same software. To check the upper computer, hold the "Breakpoint A" button. To check the lower computer, hold the "Breakpoint C" button.
**The 285e:** This module has two different versions of software.

### The Module ID

Because of the architecture of the preset system, challenges in preset backup and internal bus signal routing might be possible if multiple modules of the same type exist in the same system. For example, how does one 261e differ from another in the context of backing up to a Memory Card? For this reason, there is a function that allows you to discern certain modules from other iterations of that module.

 Module ID is a set of switches on the back of certain modules that allows you to discern other modules of the same type. If you have multiple versions of a single module in your system, giving them different module ID numbers will help you in regard to certain Buchla modular functions. Contact Buchla for details on switching module ID numbers.

 Note: Four module ID numbers are possible. If you have, for example, five 259es, and there are multiple modules with the same module ID, there will not be a problem. Since preset information is stored in the module, each module remembers its own settings. However, if you are backing up a system with more than four modules of the same type, the Memory Card will not be able to discern modules of the same type with the same module ID. In that case, one module of the same type with the same module ID could be stored with the whole system, but the second module of the same type with the same module ID would have to have its remote enable turned off during the storage of the system and first module, and then be independently stored in a different Memory Card afterwards.

 Also: H-series modules need independent module ID numbers in systems with their E-series counterparts.

### Firmware Updating

Discovering the version of your firmware allows you to visit the Buchla website to check to see if your firmware is the latest version.

 It's a good idea to update your firmware if a newer version is available.

 Many issues of strange module behavior are remedied by updating, or reloading, firmware.

### How to Update Firmware


For in-depth instructions and software to implement a firmware update, visit the "downloads" page at Buchla.com.

 Once you have downloaded your updates and transferred your target firmware update to your Buchla USB Utility Card, you must shut down your Buchla system and insert the USB Utility Card in the card slot in the back of the powered boat of your Buchla system. Then, while holding the Remote Enable button (or its substitute) of the target module, turn your system on. After two or three seconds, release the button. The new firmware will begin transferring to your module. This process can take up to two minutes. If you have a 292e, you'll be able to see its blue LED blinking during the process. Once the upload is complete, the module will return to its typical operation state, which is indicated by its LEDs lit in the normal manner of that module.

In regard to the aforementioned modules whose version and ID information is displayed using a different button than "remote enable," these exceptions stand in regard to updating firmware, as well.

 The exception to this exception is the 225h, which does not indicate its firmware version nor ID, but can have its firmware updated in this way:
Connect the input of the gate-to-pulse converter on the upper left of the module to a voltage \>2.5v (e.g., the output of the Euro-to-Buchla CV processor on the 225h with the pot offset set to 5v and banana cable from the blue "out" jack to the white banana jack), and then turn the system on.
