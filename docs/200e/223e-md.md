# The Buchla 223e 
### Tactile Input Port

  The 223e Tactile Input Port is a module and a pressure/location-sensitive polyphonic capacitive touch surface that serves as an expressive performance interface as much as it serves as a unique and powerful control interface.  There are 27 interface points on the 223e tactile surface with a variety of functions and applications. The 223e module also features a versatile arpeggiator for use with Buchla systems. 

## Information about the Tactile Surface: 
Each of the Tactile Surface’s 27 “keys” has an LED to indicate activation.  The keys can be programmed to create control voltages, pulses, location-based variations, pressure responses, and impact responses.  The longer keys can respond to finger location.  The two hexagonal keys are sensitive to location in two directions.  Information about the 223e module: The module serves as the control center for the various functions of the tactile surface, as well as provides an interface for other modules through banana jacks.  In addition to this, the module is home to a powerful arpeggiator. 

## The Pulse Outputs (red banana jack outputs 1-5) 
Pulses are often used to trigger envelopes in a system, but Buchla systems have a variety of functions that employ pulses.  Having pulse outputs may be used to trigger sounds, but also to turn functions on and off, or control other functions.  

## Setting the Pulse Outputs 
The default screen on the 223e module is that of setting the Pulse outputs 1-5.  sing the button marked “cursor” you are able to navigate between the settings of the Pulse settings page.
  
*Puls  1:Ta  2: d
3: u  4:Tc  5:Tg*

There are two settings associated with each pulse output, that of the toggle, and that of the key. The capital T in the image above indicates that the pulse output will “toggle.”  Pressing it once sends the pulse, pressing it again “turns it off.”  Turning the “data” knob while the cursor is on this setting allows you to turn off the toggle, allowing every tactile surface button press to send a pulse. The default letter “a” next to the “T” in each default pulse setting indicates which key on the tactile surface will be the one to trigger a pulse when touched.  Use the data knob to set which key will trigger a pulse for the selected pulse output.   u may access all five pulse output assignments on the “Puls” page.    

## Setting Radio Outs (multiple output sets 6-9) 
Setting the output of these individual sections (that can be combined to create polyphony, which will be discussed later) can be achieved with a single page of settings.  Press the “page” button until you arrive at the one marked “Radio.”
 
*Radio:6 ky:g Loc
CV1:334 CV2:999*

  The screen starts with an indication of which set of “radio” outputs you are currently addressing, as indicated by a number (in the above example, you’re dealing with the first set of banana outputs marked “6”).  This number can be changed by pressing the “cursor” button until it underlines the Radio number, and adjusting that number with the data knob.  ky The key selection section comes next.  Press the “cursor” button until it underlines “ky” (key).  By turning the data knob, you can convert this lower-case “ky” into an upper-case “KY,” which means you have activated the key selection process… that where you decide which tactile surface keys are going to be associated with these settings.  When you have set the “ky” to be a “KY,” you can then select the keys you need associated with this setting by touching them and lighting their LED.  Once you have all of the LEDs of the keys you want, you can use the data knob to return the “KY” to a “ky,” which means the keys are selected and protected.  Loc The next cursor selection allows you to choose what will be output from the green jack in the series of banana jacks.  The options are “location,” which outputs different voltage depending on the location of your finger on the tactile surface key, “pressure,” which acts as a sort of aftertouch based upon the amount of surface area your finger presents on the tactile surface key, and “impact,” which is a sort of velocity.  Once you’ve selected the section with the “cursor” key, you can adjust the output using the data knob.    1 This setting allows you adjust the CV output (violet jack) for the tactile surface key selected.  The voltages available range from 0 volts to 9.99 volts, allowing a wide range of voltage output (there is no decimal point indicated).  If you are looking for traditional scale voltages, “20” equals about a whole step.    CV Selectng this setting with the cursor button, you will set the CV output for the blue banana jack in the Radio grouping.  This setting is like the CV1 setting, except that if you turn the data knob full-left when this setting is selected, you can make it respond to location on the tactile surface key selected.
