©2022 Buchla USA

## Introduction

The 218e is capacitive keyboard modeled after the original 218 built in 1973, but adding an arpeggiator, a preset voltage source, and MIDI capabilities.

If you have a 218e with a Music Easel or for using in a larger system, welcome to the 200e system! These notes will acquaint your 218e.

If you have a 218e-V3, then you have a more advanced version of the 218e. This is indicated by a "v3" in the upper right corner of the 218e, but also by the presence of a new strip and other features mentioned below. If you have the original 218e (considered 218 version 2), this manual will still apply to many features that aren't listed in the "new to V3" section. Otherwise refer to the older 218e\_FC\_208CDblr\_Guide\_v2.0.PDF publication for features specific to the earlier 218e.

### What's new in "V3"?

1. There is an additional location sensitive ribbon-like "strip" for quick 0-10 volt output. This includes a pulse output. 

2. Arpeggiation can be triggered by a pulse input. (This can be changed back to have the rate to be controlled CV using a jumper. See appendix for details.)

3. Preset pads have a pulse output 

4. A new mode for preset pot 4 allows for a larger transpose range for both CV and the internal bus.

 5. A reset button allows the 218e to reboot and recalibrate the keys without need to reboot power. 

6. USB-MIDI input and output has been added. 

7. The red keys (a piano's black keys) have been integrated into the main keyboard. 

8. There is additional MIDI functionality including channel assignment to 1-16. 

9. "Main" is now called "pitch" to refer more directly to the typical 208 connection and it's expected use for pitch control.

### Important Safety Precautions

Do not disassemble this equipment. Refer all servicing to a qualified service engineer. But if you insist, be sure to follow the next advice. When installing, removing, or exchanging a module, please be certain to turn off the power supply. – power must be turned off before plugging in or unplugging modules.

Buchla power connections and cables are keyed to be used in one direction only! Reversing the connectors can cause significant system damage.

We are not liable for damage or injury due to lack of common sense: Do not use the system near water; do not take it into your bath, sauna or hot tub. Take care not to spill liquids on or into the 200. Exercise close supervision when using the instrument near children or when children are using it. The 200's power supply is for indoor use only. Do not use a damaged or alternate supply. Refer all servicing to qualified personnel. There are no user serviceable parts or adjustments inside the 200e.

## COMMON BUCHLA SYSTEM STUFF

Before getting into the details of the 218e modules, lets pursue some items that all modern Buchla 200 modules share in common. First the connections: Like its predecessors--the 200, and 100--the 200e series differentiates between control voltages, signals, and pulses.

**Control voltages** (C.V.'s) are used to specify parameter levels, range from 0 to 10 volts, and are interconnected with banana jacks and cords.

**Pulses** are used for timing information, and have two levels: 10 volt pulses transmit only transient information; while 5 volts indicates the sustain. Pulses, like C.V.'s, also employ banana interconnections.

_Fun fact: By contrast other modular synth systems often use two 3.5mm outputs/inputs to accomplish the same communication: one for "gates" and one for "triggers." But those typically 5v signals will not "trigger" most pulse inputs on a 200 system.)_

**Signals** (audio signals) are the raw material of electronic music, Signals are connected via Tini-Jax connectors and shielded patchcords. The 218e has no audio output.

### Color-coding of cables and Banana Jacks:

Note that both types of patchcords are color coded to indicate their length-- a handy feature in complex patches.

But more importantly, banana receptacles/jacks are color coded to indicate their function: C.V. INPUTS are black (and sometimes grey.)

C.V. OUTPUTS are blue, sometimes violet, and occasionally green. The 218e uses violet for its pressure output, that when plugged into a 208, is then bussed to its violet pressure output.

Pulse INPUTS are orange\*. Pulse OUTPUTS are invariably red.

(\*The Music Easel/208 includes some exceptions to the color-coding standard, Orange is used for it's association with the 208 EG fader and switch covers. Yellow is likewise used for the 208 Pulser output. Not that the 208/208C Pulser output is a like a sawtooth wave and it jack output is considered more like a CV than a pulse.)

### Ground reference connection (VERY IMPORTANT):

On every Buchla boat/housing there is a black banana jack (sometimes labeled "gnd") often near the card slot or power supply. When interconnecting/patching between two synthesizer systems, it is important that the ground reference is shared between the systems--including between two Buchla systems. The ground is not just a reference, it completes the circuit. Without this shared connection, control voltages will have behave unpredictably. The connection is not necessary inside an isolated system, but it is very important between system and especially from a LEM218 to Easel Command or another 200 or 200e system.

Why isn't this true for other electronic music boxes? Audio cables carry the ground connection with them on their "ring"; the banana cables do not. The circuit is not complete until a ground banana cable is connected between two systems. (If you do connect the systems through an audio cable, that can sometimes be enough, but it's best to connect with the banana cable.

### Capacitive keyboard grounding considerations: 

It is important to **use a 3-prong AC adapter** – like the one provided with Buchla systems— that is plugged into a grounded outlet. This 3rd pin, the "earth ground" connection is a connection to your body. If this is not an option for you, consider a ground strap. (See below)

You will also establish a better connection to your capacitive keyboard with a Buchla **ground strap** connected to the black "ground" or "gnd" banana, especially if you have a power connection that is not connected to earth ground. Accessorize with a fashionable grounding strap tight around your wrist. In a pinch, pinch/hold the metal end of a banana cable that is plugged into this same ground banana.

This same ground can also be found on the front panels of a 208C or other modules and rims of some cases it you want to simply touch those things while you play. The little lines on keys 1-29 of the 218e-V3 are also ground and can provide a minimal amount of ground connection in the absence of a good earth ground connection.

It is also true that moisture can improve your grounding and will affect the detection of your finger. Experiment with touching ground or moistening your finger. None of these procedures should be necessary in a typical environment, but the 218e is not a typical keyboard.

## Before you start: About auto-calibration

Keep your hands away on boot up and reset and count to 5: 

Every time you boot up the 218e or 218e-V3, the keyboard auto-calibrates to its environment. It takes a few seconds. That means that if a finger is near a key when you turn it on or touch it too soon, that key will be desensitized to your finger. For instance, if you are holding on the keyboard area when you turn on or hit the "reset" button, several keys may fail to function at all.

![Buchla 218e-v3](/static/img/218ev3/2-218ev3-reset.png “218e-V3 reset”)

Recalibrating/Resetting during performance?:

**A reset button was added to****  ****218e-V3** because it is actually encouraged to recalibrate just before playing the instrument just as you would re-tune up an acoustic guitar after it has adjusted to the stage environment. Resetting will ensure more consistent reading of the capacitive surface without having to reboot your whole system.

## Tactile keyboard Surface

The surface consists of 29 individual keys comprising 2-1/3 octaves. Each touch of the keyboard generates a pulse, a pressure CV, and pitch CV. These outputs are placed in the upper left of the 218, expecting to be plugged directly into the nearby the pulse, pressure, and pitch CV inputs of a 208.

![Buchla 218e-v3](/static/img/218ev3/3-218ev3-pulsepressurepitch.png “Pulse, Pressure, and Pitch outputs“)

The **pulse** output is red banana on the upper left. A red LED will indicate every pulse output. The **pressure CV** output correlates to the detected amount of finger contact on the keys. The blue LEDs next to the pressure output will get brighter as the voltage gets higher.

The " **pitch**" output corresponds to the 1.2v/octave pitch of the key.

At the Buchla standard of 1.2v/per octave, that means that the pitch C will be 0v,1.2v, 2.4v, 4.8v or 6.0v depending on the octave being played. (Notice how conveniently that relates the MIDI "C" notes 0, 12, 24, 48 and 60.) Every 1⁄2 step higher will be .1v higher.

![Buchla 218e-v3](/static/img/218ev3/4-218ev3-portamentoslope.png “Portamento”)

To the right of these outputs is **Portamento** control. Adding portamento will make the pitches slide from one to the next like a violinist sliding a finger to the next pitch. It is an endearing musical affect. To control the speed of the slide, turn the knob higher. At 0, it does not slide; At 10 it may take several seconds to reach the next

pitch. The input banana is another way to control this parameter with a CV. The CV input will add to the portamento time set by the knob.

![Buchla 218e-v3](/static/img/218ev3/5-218ev3-arpeggiationrate.png “Arpeggiator”)

To the right of portamento is the **Arpeggiator**. The 218 will arpeggiate based on the keys that are sustained with the fingers or sustain pedal. The switch determines the **PATTERN** : whether the arpeggiation is active or whether it plays an ascending or a random pattern. _ **"input"** _ As per a traditional late-200/200e system, this

orange banana indicates a pulse input. New to the 218e-V3 is the change from CV control of the rate to a pulse input for advancing the arpeggiator using pulse inputs.

The automatic **RATE** is controlled by the knob. At 0 it stops and only a pulse input will advance it. Position 1-10 will increase the steady rate of arpeggiation while pulse inputs can also advance it. This can create interlocking rhythms.

_(See the Appendix for a way to change that orange banana input from pulse to CV rate control)_

_Note that the pulser CV out of the 208C yellow jack is a sawtooth envelope, not a pulse, so if you use it for the arp pulse input, the response may be a little unpredictable. Use a CV to pulse converter to fix that._

_Also note that since the V3 version of the 218e starts it's arpeggiation as soon as the key is touched, like normal performance, you might forget to set the pattern to "none" (off) when you want to play the keyboard normally._

![Buchla 218e-v3](/static/img/218ev3/6-218ev3-strip.png “The Strip“)

### Welcome to the strip! 

New to the 218e is the additional of a strip. Many historic Buchla capacitive keyboards included a strip or two and so why shouldn't this one! And it's got a pulse! The strip, like a mod wheel, stays at the value it had when you remove your finger. Likewise it's MIDI output is CC1/Mod wheel. It's a full 0-10v output range. 

*Note: Two blue LEDs help to indicate general location near the ends and the middle LED indicates voltage level. They are directly controlled by the CV output.*

![Buchla 218e-v3](/static/img/218ev3/7-218ev3-presetvoltagesource.png “Preset Voltage Source”)

## Next is the PRESET VOLTAGE SOURCE

Only one "preset voltage source" can be selected at a time as indicated by the LEDs. The knob above each pad sets the output CV from 0-10v. The corresponding voltage will appear at the blue **"output" banana** when that knob/source is selected.

**With V3 a pulse output has been added to the preset voltage section to allow triggering additional events**. For example, you may stack this pulse output with the main pulse output to hear the octave events when ADD TO PITCH is set to octave. Or for 200e users, this pulse output is useful when you also send the preset CV output to selection inputs--orange and black banana jack pairs--on a 252e, 225e, 272e, or 266e.

![Buchla 218e-v3](/static/img/218ev3/8-218ev3-addtopitch.png “Add to Pitch switch”)

## TRANSPOSITION: the ADD TO PITCH switch 

Octave Transposition: use the "**octaves**" switch setting for instant

transposition of the pitch output using just pads 1 to 4

If used in combination with the "output" CV, the user might use the preset output settings from the knobs to automatically change a parameter of a sound based on the octave being played.

Non-traditional transpositions using the knobs: The " **preset**" switch setting will add the CV-- as set by the selected knob--to the pitch output. This is not quantized to 1⁄2 steps. You could set it to non-tempered transpositions or set the knobs carefully to do transpositions of traditional intervals to modulate the key.

![Buchla 218e-v3](/static/img/218ev3/9-218ev3-knob4.png “Transpose”)

## NEW: Knob 4 TRANSPOSITION

When the yellow LED next to "trn" is lit under Preset Voltage Source knob 4 —the rightmost knob— the position of this knob will determine octave transposition of the " **pitch**" CV, the internal bus and MIDI outputs.

To enable this mode, go into edit mode and touch key 27 to toggle on or off. _(See how to get into EDIT MODE in the next section.)_

Try it! The yellow LED will flash with every octave shift and you should hear the results.

*(CV changes out the "pitch" banana don't occur until position 3.6. See the chart below.)*

Not only is this a unique way to quickly shift octaves, this feature accomplishes two other things: #1. This frees up using pads 1-3 for other functions while still having independent transpose control.

#2. The knob's 0-2.4 range allows users of 261e, 259e and AuxCard to control i2c messages for octaves lower than the 208C, and allows this mere 29 note keyboard to play a full 0-127 range for MIDI notes.

See the below chart to see how these transpositions affect the outputs

_You might notice that the knob position has a relationship with 0-10 volts and with MIDI note numbers. But to really understand it, just use your ears!_

You can simultaneously set the ADD TO PITCH switch to "octaves" and use the preset voltage source pads for even more octave control.

That is all you need to know to start playing. But if you want to change the response settings on your 218e-V3, or turn on and off various features, or take advantage of some of the MIDI output options, here's how. . .

![Buchla 218e-v3](/static/img/218ev3/10-218ev3-configuration.png “Configure settings”)

## EDIT MODE: Configure your preferred settings.

To enter edit mode, **hold the preset pads 1 and 2** until they flash quickly. The LEDs will then flash slowly to indicate it's in this edit configuration mode.

_On the 218e-V3 those pads have 2 lines on them. Hold the two pads with the two lines for two seconds_.

Once in this mode, touch keys and move pots to configure per the descriptions below.

Keys 1-16: Assign the MIDI output channel 1-16 New to the 218e-V3 is channel output assignment. In edit mode, touching keys 1-16 will reassign MIDI output to the respective MIDI channel. (Be careful that you don't change the channel accidentally.) MIDI channel settings are saved.

Keys 17-26 remain playable in edit mode with no consequences and are a good way to test your changes.

Key 27: Toggle on and off knob 4's TRANSPOSE mode (see section above for a description.)

Key 28: Toggle on and off remote enable. On 218e-V3 there is an LED status indicator. _Per the older 218e software, this can also be done by holding pads 3 and 4._ See REMOTE ENABLE description in the following input and output connections section.

Key 29: Toggle on and off MIDI poly mode. "pm" is it's LED status indicator. Your MIDI output is now polyphonic! Toggle it off it you want the MIDI to work monophonically to mimic the monophonic CV output.

![Buchla 218e-v3](/static/img/218ev3/11-218ev3-stripalone.png “Setting with strip”)![Buchla 218e-v3](/static/img/218ev3/12-218ev3-portamentoknob.png “Setting portamento with strip”)

Strip plus Portamento knob: Strip Portamento speed/slew

Touch and hold the strip while setting the portamento knob to change the amount of
portamento for the strip. The higher the knob value, the slower the CV will change its voltage. This is also known as "slew" and is a nice way to smooth out the slides or create delayed changes. _To make it less likely that you set it accidentally, we require that you touch the strip while you turn the knob. And in this way you can instantly test the results._

More configuration control comes from the Preset Voltage Source knobs (numbering 1 to 4; left to right) _The settings will not change until you turn the knobs._

![Buchla 218e-v3](/static/img/218ev3/13-218ev3-MIDIknobsettings.png “Using knobs for settings”)

Bus assignment lowest MIDI velocity MIDI velocity sensitivity Pressure sensitivity

Knob 1: Assign (or disable) internal bus note output Turn knob 1 and the static illumination of the four preset pads indicates the internal bus assignment. The internal bus, especially useful on a 200e system, can be used to control select modules (such as the 259e, 261, 281e and 292e and more) without the use of bananas cables. Assign the internal bus output by turning preset knob 1 through selections: none; A, B, C, D; A+B; C+D; A+B+C+D. If you don't use the internal bus and are only using the banana connections or MIDI output, disable the bus by turning the knob to 0.

**What connects to the internal bus?**
The 208C "keyboard" inputs for pulse and pitch respond to notes on internal bus A when the 208C is in remote or both mode. But that is only if you have the 208MIDI daughterboard installed. ("Easel Commands" have with the 208MIDI board installed.) The AuxCard oscillator listens to internal bus C__ **.** _ _(If you have an LEM218 you could connect to the bus through the 10-pin 2mm power connector on the right.)

*Other Buchla modules that can respond to the internal MIDI bus include 261e, 259e, 281e/h, and 292e/h. Similar to MIDI, NoteOn messages (pitch/bus assignment/velocity) messages are sent; Unlike MIDI, the CC messages can NOT be over the internal bus.*

Knob 2&3: Velocity adjustment for internal bus and MIDI output In configuration mode, preset knobs 2 and 3 adjust the minimum and maximum velocity values: Knob 2 is the minimum; knob 3 is the velocity sensitivity. If knob 2\>3, then the velocity will always be the value set by 2. Use only keys 17-26 to instantly test velocity without accidentally editing other features.

Knob 4: Pressure sensitivity If the pressure does not respond to your liking, experiment with this "pressure" sensitivity. 10 is the most sensitive setting and the output will jump to 10v with just your finger tips. While turning the knob, use keys 17-26 to test and set pressure in real-time.

![Buchla 218e-v3](/static/img/218ev3/14-exitedit.png “Exit edit”)

Exit edit mode the same way you entered the mode:
 
hold preset pads 1 and 2 until they flash quickly again. _Upon exiting the edit mode, the settings are saved._

_Note: If you have an old 218e with old firmware, not all settings are saved_

## Other 218e Input and output connections: 

I/O connections can come from any of **LEM218, 5XIO, Easel case, or EMBIO**. The 10-pin cable connection includes the USB, sustain pedal and standard MIDI connections all in one cable. Be sure to plug it in the correct header. _The older 218e or older IO interfaces use a 6pin cable. See Appendix II for information on that._

**USB:** With the 218e-V3, USB-MIDI has been added and functions the same as the usual MIDI in and out. Be sure to connect to one of these interfaces with the 10-pin cable. (There is no USB on the older 218e)

**Sustain:** The Easel comes with a 1⁄4" connection labeled "sus" or "sustain." The keyboard will hold one pitch or latch arpeggiated pitches while holding down sustain.

_The polarity of the sustain switch will be detected upon pressing reset or during boot up. Be careful when resetting/recalibrating just before a show that you are not holding down the sustain pedal._

## MIDI Output: Notes, pressure and Continuous Controller's 1,2 and 6

In addition to pressure (channel aftertouch), and new to the 218e-V3, the strip puts on CC1 (Mod wheel) on the assigned channel, Preset Voltage Source puts out CC2 (Breath) and the Portamento knob puts out CC6 (portamento) on the assigned channel. And if set to "none" on the ADD TO PITCH switch, touching pads 1-4 will put out the four lowest MIDI notes on channel 16 to allow MIDI note triggering of 4 sequences or scenes.

See edit mode to make changes to MIDI channel assignment and velocity settings.

## MIDI Input: Use of the 218e for MIDI to CV conversion: 

The 218e converts incoming MIDI signals _ **on MIDI channel 1** _ from the MIDI input just as if you were playing the 218e keyboard. MIDI notes become pulses and pitch CV outputs, and channel pressure messages from 0-127 get sent out the pressure output as 0-10v. In fact, all the controls of portamento, arpeggiation, and preset voltage source selection will still apply when using this MIDI input. The octave setting will transpose the input just as it would when you play the 218e keyboard. Use the lowest octave setting when switched to "octaves" or switch to "none" if you want to get the non-transposed input. (C0 or [MIDI note 25] will equal 0 volts in this setting and is the lowest note the 218e responds to.) _ **MIDI input to the 218e will be most useful for 208 users** _ _who don't have a 208C\*. That's because there are fewer ways of controlling a 208C than the 208C's internal 208MIDI card. For most new Easel systems with a 208C, the 3.5mm MIDI in jack will be connected to the 208C directly._

For new Easel users, consult with the EMBIO guide on how to directly the MIDI Input to the 218e instead of the default 208C.  **For older Easel cases** , a 6-pin header and cable can be soldered to the 218e-V3 to make it compatible with the older BEMI 2013-2020 case. See Appendix VI

] You can also use the internal bus A to put out pitch CV's if you have remote enabled your

## REMOTE ENABLE the 218e to put MIDI note input onto the 200e internal bus or enable internal bus A output to the 218e banana jacks:

When you have remote enabled your 218e, internal bus A will get sent out the CV pitch outputs, but also MIDI input on channels 1-4 will be turned into internal bus messages on bus channels A-D, respectively. For instance, to send a MIDI message to the AuxCard on bus C, you can send a MIDI message on channel 3.

_ **Remote enabling the 218e may be most useful for 200e users** __._

To remote enable, **press and hold preset pads 3 & 4** until they flash or set it with key 28 in edit mode. On the 218e-V3 the "rem en" LED will indicate on status. The 218e will not be remote enabled upon boot up. This is a temporary un-saved setting. On older 218e's Quick flashes indicates turning on remote enable; slow flashes indicates the turning off of remote enable, but there is no status LED.

## Appendix I: Troubleshooting/FAQs

Why doesn't transpose knob 4 do anything until it gets to 3.6?: It actually IS working behind the scenes for internal and MIDI communication, but the CV output of the pitch will not change until the bottom most note matches it's MIDI note equivalent. See the transpose section above. See the table in the section above called **Knob 4 TRANSPOSITION**

When I play two keys the second one doesn't play or it plays late!: Make sure you are not in Arpeggiation pattern is set to **"none".** Because arpeggiation starts with the key touch and the arpeggiation rate can be set to 0, it can be easy to not recognize this mistake.

Sometimes it misses pulses when I play a key twice: Make sure when you repeatedly hit a key that your finger fully leaves the sensitive area. Because there are no moving keys, it can be difficult to know when the key is no longer sensing the presence of your finger.

Some keys seem less sensitive: It is possible that some part of your body was close to the keyboard when it calibrated after reset. Or too much time has passed since your last calibration and the environment has changed enough. Try pressing "reset," keep hands away and wait for it to finish calibrating. (See this manual's sections on grounding and auto-calibration for more explanation.)

The knobs/pots don't do anything close to 0 and 10: This is not unusual. Most potentiometers have a small area at the top and bottom of their movement where the resistance doesn't change even though the knob can turn a little.

## Appendix II: FIRMWARE UPDATES:

We like to add features when it's possible. Firmware updates are available via USB, but there are a few steps to this. To find out how to update the 218e-V3 to the latest software, see the publication: _ **How to do a 218e-V3 firmware update.pdf** _

We have eliminated the 218e's original Firmware card method of updating in the interest of being more universal. If you have an older 218e, the Firmware card method would still be the way to update. But 218e-V3 updates are not compatible with the older 218e.

You can know what Firmware you have if you have a 225e or 206e to read it: To see the firmware version displayed by a preset manager, **hold presets pad 2, 3, & 4** until the message is displayed by the preset manager (after about 2 seconds). If this does not work, you might have a very early version of the old 218e Firmware.

**Banana Outputs in Eurorack ranges?****  ****Hold down all four preset pads** until the LEDs flash to get into this **Euro mode**.\*\* Both the 218e and 218e-V3 have a hidden mode for 1v/octave pitch, 0-8v pressure, and 5v pulse outputs. Eurorack range mode is not saved. Rebooting/resetting the 218e will reset to the Buchla standard 0-10v outputs and1.2v/octave

**The optional LEM218 housing** includes more options. See below.

**h-Power input: Power can come from a Buchla boat that has an accessible h-power outlet.** Use this 2mm 10-pin optional power to connect all the power needed including ground and the internal MIDI bus through an h-series power cable.

When using h-power, don't connect the AC adapter.

**v/oct trimpot** : The LEM218's 1v/octave trimpot can be adjusted to maintain 1 volt per octave at the 3.5mm jack output.

**3.5mm jack outputs** with 1v/octave pitch, 0-8v pressure, strip CV, and 5v gate outputs for use with Eurorack equipment.

**The LEM218-V3 adds USB and uses 3.5mm MIDI outputs and inputs.**

Cable adapters to 5pin DIN connections provided.

**Sustain jack.**

## Appendix IV: Arpeggiation input options:

![Buchla 218e-v3](/static/img/218ev3/16-218ev3-arpeggiationrate2.png “Arpeggiation rate adjustment”)

The user may change the pulse input to CV control of the arpeggiation rate to get the same behavior as the older 218e:

This change requires a technician with basic soldering skills. By factory default there is a resistor at "ARP-P". "P" = pulse. Removing this resistor and then resoldering this same resistor on to the "ARP-CV" position changes the orange banana's input to control the arpeggiation rate with a control voltage. (This can be done with one soldering iron, but to do this more easily may require 2 soldering irons.)

Though the banana color should in theory change from orange to black, it is not required.

It is also possible to reassign the portamento banana jack input to control the speed of the arpeggiator instead while keeping the pulse input, but that modification was not considered in the original design, so the modification is slightly more involved and requires a technician. Contact customer support if you need that option and have access to a technician.

## Appendix VI. I/O options for 218e-V3 in older cases:

![Buchla 218e-v3](/static/img/218ev3/17-218ev3-io1.png “”)

**For IO connections of a new 218**** e ****-V3 to an old LEM218, or older IO board** , or older Easel suitcase, this will require soldering of through hole components. There is an unpopulated connector labeled H1. A connector can be added here to make the 218e-V3 backward compatible with those older IO panels. Please contact Buchla USA for more information.

![Buchla 218e-v3](/static/img/218ev3/18-218ev3-io2.png “”)

Additionally, IC1 would need to be populated to provide the MIDI Input when using the 6pin connector.

**Backward power compatibility** for the 218e-V3: The simplest way to provide power to the 218e-V3 is through the h-power connector that was created for the h-series modules. If you do not have an h-series power connector on your system, there is « e2h adapter » board that can be purchased. The e2h board adapts the power and adds a 3.3v generator.

![Buchla 218e-v3](/static/img/218ev3/119-218ev3-io3.png “”)

The 2nd method is much more involved and requires a qualified technician. That would be to wire up an old 200-series connector using the large pads. The holes are labeled. In addition, U3 must be populated with a 3.3v generator and the h-power connector « H4 »

removed. (Or optionally H4 can remain if the technician contacts Buchla USA for information on how to also cut the 3.3v line from the h- series power connector.)

## Appendix V: I/O options for older 218e.

## I/O connections to an older 218e or 218 case: The 6-pin SIP header.

Various older Easel cases include MIDI In and Sustain, and the LEM housing adds MIDI Out. The Buchla 218e can also be put in another housing and still retain those connections via the 6-pin SIP header. The old LEM218 pairs with the old 218e for power and I/O and includes this 6-pin connector. This 6-pin connector (on the inside board on the right side) was designed to connect directly to panel jacks: The 2 MIDI In pins (pins1&2) can connected directly to a panel mounted 5-pin DIN jack (pins 4&5 respectively); MIDI Out (pins 3&4) connect to 5-pin DIN (pins 5&4 respectively); Ground (pin5) should connect to MIDI Out Din pin2 (and not to MIDI In) and also to Sustain pedal ground; and the Sustain switch signal (pin6) should connect to a sustain pedal input.

For an old 218e inside a 200e system, the simplest way to connect MIDI to a 218e is with the Buchla "5XIO" IO board header H6.

This header connects MIDI In and MIDI Out 5-pin DIN connections (not USB) via the 6-pin connector from the 218e and a panel 1⁄4" jack can be wired to pads on the left side for sustain.

The EMBIO panel also includes this header so that older 218e's can plug use the MIDI and sustain jacks in the newer 10-panel Easel case.
